# Hello, I'm Wendelin üëã

I'm an IT professional with over a decade of experience under my belt. My journey in the tech industry has been a thrilling ride, and I've been fortunate enough to wear many hats - developer, architect, consultant, and more.

## üåê My Interests

My interests are broad, but I have a particular passion for:

- **Azure Cloud Architecture**: I love designing and building robust, scalable solutions on Azure. The cloud has revolutionized how we think about software architecture, and I'm excited to be part of that revolution.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: I believe in the power of DDD to create software that accurately reflects the business domain and is flexible to change. It's a philosophy that guides my approach to software design.

- **Azure DevOps**: I'm a firm believer in the DevOps culture and practices, and Azure DevOps is my tool of choice. It's all about bringing development and operations together to deliver software faster and more reliably.

- **Messaging**: I have extensive experience with various messaging systems and patterns, which are crucial for building distributed, decoupled systems.

- **Containerization**: I've worked with Docker, Azure Container Apps and Kubernetes to containerize applications, making them portable, scalable, and easier to manage.

- **Blazor**: I'm excited about the potential of Blazor for building interactive web UIs with C# instead of JavaScript. It's a game-changer for .NET developers.

- **Azure Functions**: I've used Azure Functions to build serverless applications that are event-driven and can scale on demand. It's a powerful tool for building microservices and other cloud-native applications.
